Easily split WordPress-galleries without any fancy css or js.

== Description ==
*Garee's Split Gallery* allows you to number the images to be shown (e.g. show='1-3â€²) and uses the native WordPress-gallery-shortcode to do the rest. Break your galleries apart - but don't insert hardcoded img-tags directly. In addition you are able to set default-values for the gallery-shortcode. E.g. if you'd like your gallery-items to link to the image-file directly, you can set that default in the settings-page and no longer need to insert `file="link"` into the shortcode.

Main-advantages:

* easily split your galleries
* show only images of a certain filetype
* set default-values
* uses native Wordpress-gallery (no additional code)

Just insert the shortcode anywhere on your blog: `[split_gallery show='1-3']`

With the exception of 'include' and 'exclude' you can use all the official shortcode-attributes of the [native-gallery-shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Gallery_Shortcode) to further customize the gallery:

`[split_gallery id="2144" show="4-6" order="DESC" orderby="ID" size="medium" icontag="span" link="file"]`
